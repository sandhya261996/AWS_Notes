## How to upgrade or downgrade a system with zero downtime in aws ?

<ol>
<li>Open EC2 console.</li>
<li>Choose Operating System AMI.</li>
<li>Launch an instance with the new instance type.</li>
<li>Install all the updates.</li>
<li>Install applications.</li>
<li>Test the instance to see if it's working.</li>
<li>If working, deploy the new instance and replace the older instance.</li>
<li>Upgrading or downgrading a system with zero downtime in AWS (Amazon Web Services) typically involves implementing strategies like using Elastic Load Balancers (ELBs), Auto Scaling Groups, and Blue-Green deployments. The specific steps can vary depending on your application architecture and requirements, but here's a general guide on how to achieve this:</li>
<details><summary>Note: This guide assumes you have a basic understanding of AWS services and concepts.</summary></details>
<li>Set Up Elastic Load Balancer (ELB):</li>
<details><summary>Create an Application Load Balancer (ALB) or Network Load Balancer (NLB) depending on your application's needs.
Configure your ALB/NLB to distribute traffic to your instances. Ensure that health checks are configured to monitor the instance's health.</summary></details>
<li> Create an Auto Scaling Group:</li>
<details><summary>Set up an Auto Scaling Group (ASG) with the desired minimum and maximum instance counts.
Configure scaling policies for your ASG based on CPU utilization, network traffic, or custom metrics. This allows AWS to automatically add or remove instances as needed.</summary></details>
<li>Implement Blue-Green Deployment:</li>

<li> Implement Blue-Green Deployment:</li>
<details><summary>Create a new Amazon Machine Image (AMI) or use an existing one for your upgraded/downgraded system.
Launch a new set of instances (Green environment) using the updated AMI.
Deploy your application to the Green environment.
Test your application thoroughly in the Green environment to ensure it works as expected.</summary></details>
<li>Update the Load Balancer:</li>
<details><summary>
Gradually update the ALB/NLB target group to include instances from the Green environment while removing instances from the old environment (Blue).
Use a gradual approach to redirect traffic from the Blue to the Green environment by adjusting the ALB/NLB target group weights.</summary></details>

<li>Complete the Transition:</li>
<details><summary>Once you are confident that the Green environment is stable and performs well, you can decommission the Blue environment.
</summary></details>
<li> Consider Database and Data Migration:</li>
<details><summary>If your system relies on a database, you'll need to plan for database schema changes or data migration as part of the upgrade/downgrade process.
</summary></details>
<li>Use Elastic Beanstalk (Optional):</li>
<details><summary>If you are using AWS Elastic Beanstalk, it provides built-in support for Blue-Green deployments, making the process even easier.
</summary></details>
<li> Backup and Restore:</li>
<details><summary>
Always have backups in place, and if necessary, be prepared to restore the system to its previous state in case of issues during the upgrade or downgrade.
By following these steps and leveraging AWS services like Elastic Load Balancers, Auto Scaling Groups, and Blue-Green deployments, you can minimize or even eliminate downtime during system upgrades or downgrades in AWS. Make sure to adapt these general guidelines to your specific application and infrastructure requirements.
